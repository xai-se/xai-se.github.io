    "The success of software engineering projects largely depends on complex decision-making (see {numref}`Figure {number} <complex-decision-making>`). For example, which tasks should a developer do first,\n",
    "who should perform this task, is the software of high quality, is a software system reliable and resilient enough to deploy, etc. However,\n",
    "erroneous decision-making for these complex questions is costly in terms of money and reputation.\n",
