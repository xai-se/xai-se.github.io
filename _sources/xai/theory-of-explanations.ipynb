    "## A Theory of Explainability\n",
    "\n",
    "According to philosophy, social science, and psychology theories, a\n",
    "common definition of *explainability or interpretability* is *the degree\n",
    "to which a human can understand the reasons behind a decision or an\n",
    "action* {cite}`Miller19`. The explainability of AI/ML algorithms can be\n",
    "achieved by (1) making the entire decision-making process transparent\n",
    "and comprehensible and (2) explicitly providing an explanation for each\n",
    "decision {cite}`lipton2018mythos` (since an explanation is not likely applicable to\n",
    "all decisions {cite}`leake2014evaluating`. Hence, research has emerged to\n",
    "explore how to explain decisions made by complex, black-box models and\n",
    "how explanations are presented in a form that would be easily understood\n",
    "(and hence, accepted) by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explainability Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanations of AI/ML systems can be presented in various forms to serve various goals of different stakeholders.\n",
    "For example, the goal of software managers is to understand the general characteristics of software projects that are associated with defect-proneness to chart appropriate qualitity improvement plans.\n",
    "Thus, explanations needed by such software managers are generic explanations that describe the whole reasons and logic behind decisions of AI/ML systems.\n",
    "On the other hand, the goal of software developers is to understand why a particular file is predicted as defective by AI/ML systems to mitigate the risk of such file being defective.\n",
    "In this case, explanations needed by software developers are explanations that are specific to such file and describe the reasons and logic behind defective predictions made by AI/ML systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "TODO?\n",
    "Different stakeholders have different goals, thus require different forms of explanations. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Explanations?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a philosophical and psychological theory of explanations,\n",
    "Salmon  {cite}`Salmon84` argue that explanations can be presented as a causal\n",
    "chain of causes that lead to the decision. Causal chains can be\n",
    "classified into five categories {cite}`Hilton2005`: temporal, coincidental,\n",
    "unfolding, opportunity chains and pre-emptive. Each type of causal chain\n",
    "is thus associated with an explanation type. However, identifying the\n",
    "complete causal chain of causes is challenging, since most AI/ML\n",
    "techniques produce only correlations instead of causations.\n",
    "In contrast, Miller {cite}`Miller19` argue that explanations can be presented\n",
    "as answers to why-questions. Similarly, Lipton {cite}`lipton1990contrastive` also share\n",
    "a similar view of explanations as being contrastive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Intelligibility Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lim et al. {cite}`lim2019these` categorized questions towards the inference mechanism of AI/ML systems into: What, Why, Why Not, What If, and How To. \n",
    "Below, we provide an example of questions for each type of the intelligibility questions.\n",
    "- *What*: What is the logic behind the AI/ML models?\n",
    "- *Why*: Why is an instance predicted as TRUE?\n",
    "- *Why Not*: Why not is an instance predicted as FALSE?\n",
    "- *How To*: How can we reverse the prediction of an instance (e.g., from TRUE to FALSE) generated by the system?\n",
    "- *What If*: What would the system predict if the values of an instance are changed?\n",
    "<!-- While they initially found that Why and Why Not explanations were most effective in promoting system understanding and trust [65], -->\n",
    "<!-- they later found that users use different strategies to check model behavior and thus use different intelligibility queries for the same interpretability goals [68, 70].  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scopes of Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "Explainability can be achieved at two levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "The explainability of software analytics can be achieved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Explanability:** Using interpretable machine learning\n",
    "techniques (e.g., decision tree, decision rules or logistic\n",
    "regression techniques) or intrinsic model-specific techniques (e.g.,\n",
    "ANOVA, variable importance) so the entire predictions and\n",
    "recommendations process are transparent and comprehensible. Such\n",
    "intrinsic model-specific techniques aim to provide the global\n",
    "explainability. Thus, users can only understand how the model works\n",
    "globally (e.g., by inspecting a branch of decision trees). However,\n",
    "users often do not understand why the model makes that prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local Explanability:** Using model-agnostic techniques (e.g.,\n",
    "LIME {cite}`ribeiro2016should`) to explain the predictions of the\n",
    "software analytics models (e.g., neural network, random forest).\n",
    "Such post-hoc model-agnostic techniques can provide an explanation\n",
    "for each prediction (i.e., an instance to be explained). Users can\n",
    "then understand why the prediction is made by the software analytics\n",
    "models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "To better explain types of explanations, we first provide definitions of *Fact* and *Foil* with examples in the context of defect prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact** refers to a cause that is actually happened (what happened).\\\n",
    "Example: *A.java* is predicted as defective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foil** refers to an expected or plausible-to-happen cause that is an alternative to Fact.\\\n",
    "Examples: (1) *A.java* is predicted as clean. and (2) *B.java* is predicted as clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the fact and foil, Lim et al. {cite}`lim2019these` discussed 4 types of explanations as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Causal Explanation** refers to an explanation that is focused on selected causes relevant to interpreting the observation with respect to existing knowledge. An example of causal explanation presented as an answer to a question with respect to a fact cause example is provided below.\\\n",
    "Example: [Why] Why *A.java* is predicted as defective?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contrastive Explanation** refers to an explanation that is focused on the contrastive between a fact and a foil.\n",
    "Recently, Van Bouwel and Weber {cite}`van2002remote` futher distinguised contrastive explanations into 3 types as follows:\n",
    "    - *Property-contrast* (P-contrast) is the differences in the Properties within an object.\\\n",
    "    Example: [Why not] Why *A.java* is predicted as defective, rather than clean?\n",
    "    - *Object-contrast* (O-contrast) is the differences between two Objects.\\\n",
    "    Example: [Why not] Why *A.java* is predicted as defective, while *B.java* is predicted as clean?\n",
    "    - *Time-contrast* is the differences within an object over Time.\\\n",
    "    Example: [Why not] Why *A.java* is predicted as defective in the current release, but was predicted as clean in the previous release?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Counterfactual Explanation** refers to an explanation of what needs to change for an alternative outcome to happen (foil).\\\n",
    "Example: [How to] How can we reverse the prediction of *A.java* generated by the model (from defective to clean)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transfactual Explanation** refers to an explanation that explains a hyperthetical scenario of *what if* the factors were different, then what the effect would be.\n",
    "Example: [What if] What would be the prediction of *A.java* if its size and complexity were changed?\n",
