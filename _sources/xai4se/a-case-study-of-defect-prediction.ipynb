    "# A Case Study of Defect Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In todayâ€™s increasingly digitalized world, software defects are widespread and enormously expensive, but they are very hard to detect, predict, and prevent. \n",
    "Thus, a failure to eliminate software defects in safety-critical systems could result in serious injury to people, threats to life, death, and disasters. \n",
    "Here, we present 3 use-case scenarios of eXplainable AI defect prediction framework to achieve the followings:\n",
    "- Generating fine-grained predictions in order to help developers *localize which lines of code are the most risky* so developers can allocate limited software quality assurance activities in a cost-effective manner{cite}`wattanakriengkrai2020`.\n",
    "- Generating explanations for each prediction to help developers *understand why a file is predicted as defective*{cite}`jiarpakdee2020modelagnostic`.\n",
    "- Generating actionable guidance to help managers *chart appropriate quality improvement plans*."
